## How it works

Designed for error/failure reporting.

Receives signal from 4 units divided into 2 groups, A and B (0, 1 and 2, 3 respectively). Outputs 4 values from 0 - 3 depending on if either unit on group A or B has a signal (output 0 and 1) and if both units on groups A and B has a signal (output 2 and 3). The circuit is NO.

## How to test

Simulate in Wokwi, and test DIP switches 1 through 4.

## External hardware
